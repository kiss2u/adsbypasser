# AdsBypasser

[![Build Status](https://github.com/adsbypasser/adsbypasser/actions/workflows/unit-test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adsbypasser/adsbypasser/actions)

A lightweight userscript that automatically skips countdown ads, bypasses continue pages, and prevents ad pop-up windows on many supported sites.

Install releases and read docs on the project's [Homepage](https://adsbypasser.github.io/).

## Features

- ✅ Skip countdowns and "continue" redirect pages where possible
- ✅ Prevent common ad pop-up windows/overlays
- ✅ Site-specific handlers for many domains (see [Supported Sites](https://adsbypasser.github.io/))
- ✅ Lightweight client-side userscript — no analytics or phoning home
- ❌ Does **not** bypass reCAPTCHA or other interactive bot checks

## Supported Sites & Platforms

See the full list of supported sites on the [homepage](https://adsbypasser.github.io/) and platform notes in the [Wiki](https://github.com/adsbypasser/adsbypasser/wiki).

### Reporting Issues

When opening an issue for a broken/missing site handler, please include:

1. A reproducible example URL (or local HTML if protected)
2. Browser + userscript manager + script version
3. Console errors and expected behavior

### Adding Site Support

To add support for a new site:

1. Create a new file in `src/sites/{category}/{domain}.js`
2. Follow the pattern in existing site handlers
3. Add JSDoc comments with `@domain` annotations
4. Test your implementation

If you need help implementing a handler, tag the issue or PR and request guidance — maintainers and community members can advise.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why doesn't AdsBypasser bypass reCAPTCHA?**

A: reCAPTCHA is an interactive bot check and is intentionally not bypassed.

**Q: AdsBypasser doesn't work on a page — what now?**

A: Open an issue with the URL, userscript version, browser and a short description; attach console output if available.

**Q: How do I update the script?**

A: Userscript managers automatically update scripts. You can also manually check for updates in your manager's dashboard.
